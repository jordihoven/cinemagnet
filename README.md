# Cinemagnet
A simple app where you can search any movie by name, resulting in movie details and a magnet link.

## Idea
The idea is to build a simple vue 3 frontend, host via netlify and use firebase as a backend.

### Next steps
- [x] create a git repo and setup a clean vue 3 boilerplate
- [ ] host via netlify
- [ ] design first iteration in Figma
- [ ] add Omdb api to get movie details
- [ ] research how to fetch magnet links for the resulting movies (maybe yts api?)
- [ ] build first version...
